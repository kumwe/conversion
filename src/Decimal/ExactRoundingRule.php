/**
 * The decision a declared rounding rule makes about the digits a target scale discards.

 * Money and quantity conversions narrow their exact product the same way, and `ExactDecimalArithmetic`
 * has no idea which of the two it is narrowing, so the two contracts share this one contract and nothing
 * else. Each still names its own vocabulary — `MoneyRoundingMode` and `QuantityRoundingMode` — because
 * which modes a business offers for a currency and for a unit of measure are separate declarations that
 * travel in separate payloads, and collapsing them into one enum would let a money conversion be
 * described in a quantity's terms.
 *
 * Implementations are backed enums, so a mode is a value an export can carry and a reader can resolve,
 * not a strategy object a caller has to construct.
