 * The port an extension implements to be the source of a unit conversion factor.

 * The conversion table is deliberately outside core. A metric standards table, a trade-unit table
 * administered by hand, a supplier feed and a contractual case size are all implementations of this one
 * contract, and none of them is wired into core: a provider reaches the conversion pipeline only through
 * the catalog its host composes — in Kumwe App, by being contributed through the extension registrar —
 * and it is withdrawn with the rest of its package on disable, uninstall or trust revocation.
 *
 * The business rule lives entirely behind this interface — which factor, from whom, applying when,
 * approved by whom. What core holds the implementation to is only that the factor it returns is
 * complete: it relates the units that were asked about, it is not dated after the instant that was asked
 * about, and it is attributed to this provider by name.
