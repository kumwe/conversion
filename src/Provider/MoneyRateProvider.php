/**
 * The port an extension implements to be the source of an exchange rate.
 *
 * Rate sourcing is deliberately outside core. An external rate service, a manually administered table,
 * a bank feed and a contractual fixed rate are all implementations of this one contract, and none of
 * them is wired into core: a provider reaches the conversion pipeline only through the catalog its
 * host composes — in Kumwe App, by being contributed through the extension registrar — and it is
 * withdrawn with the rest of its package on disable, uninstall or trust revocation.
 *
 * The business rule lives entirely behind this interface — which rate, from whom, applying when,
 * approved by whom. What core holds the implementation to is only that the rate it returns is complete:
 * it prices the pair that was asked about, it is not dated after the instant that was asked about, and
 * it is attributed to this provider by name.
