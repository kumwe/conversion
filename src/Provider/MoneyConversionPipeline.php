 * whether it will answer, takes the first rate offered, and applies it through the core converter.
 *
 * A provider's answer is not taken on trust. A rate attributed to a different provider, or one that
 * prices another pair or postdates the instant asked about, is refused rather than converted with, so a
 * package cannot launder an unattributable rate through the platform's own contract.
