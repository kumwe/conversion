/**
 * What a caller asks for when it wants a stored amount presented in another currency.
 *
 * The request is the half of the conversion contract a rate provider reads. It names the amount, the
 * currency it is to be shown in, the instant the rate must be as at, and — because rounding is a
 * declared step and never an accident — the exact shape the answer is to be rounded to. A provider
 * decides which rate answers this; it never decides what the answer looks like.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches storage. A request is built above stored exact values, is satisfied for one
 * presentation or one report row, and is discarded.
