/**
 * The one rule that turns a request and a rate into a converted amount.
 *
 * Core owns the arithmetic so that two extensions converting the same amount with the same rate produce
 * the same figure and the same provenance. The rule is short and deliberately has no discretion in it:
 * multiply exactly, round once by the mode the request declared, and hand back a value that carries the
 * unrounded product beside the rounded one. Choosing the rate is the provider's decision and choosing
 * the rounding is the request's; neither is made here.
 *
 * The converter reads stored values and writes none. It holds no state and no collaborator, which is
 * what lets a domain object and an application service use the same instance of it.
