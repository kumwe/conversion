/**
 * What a caller asks for when it wants a stored quantity expressed in another unit of measure.
 *
 * The request is the half of the conversion contract a table owner reads. It names the quantity, the
 * unit it is to be expressed in, the instant the factor must be as at, and — because rounding is a
 * declared step and never an accident — the exact shape the answer is to be rounded to. A provider
 * decides which factor answers this; it never decides what the answer looks like.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches storage. A request is built above stored exact values, is satisfied for one
 * presentation, one picking list or one report row, and is discarded.
