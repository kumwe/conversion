/**
 * The one rule that turns a request and a factor into a converted quantity.
 *
 * Core owns the arithmetic so that two extensions converting the same quantity with the same factor
 * produce the same figure and the same provenance — which is exactly the disagreement about what a case
 * of a product is that owning the contract exists to prevent. The rule is short and deliberately has no
 * discretion in it: multiply exactly, round once by the mode the request declared, and hand back a value
 * that carries the unrounded product beside the rounded one. Choosing the factor is the provider's
 * decision and choosing the rounding is the request's; neither is made here.
 *
 * The converter reads stored values and writes none. It holds no state and no collaborator, which is
 * what lets a domain object and an application service use the same instance of it.
