 * An exact amount bound to the unit it is measured in.

 * physical amount and unit columns, rebuilds it on read, and refuses a unit that differs from one
 * pinned in the field configuration. The unit is an opaque portable identifier — nothing in *this
 * type* converts between units, so two stored quantities are only comparable when their units are
 * identical.
 *
 * The platform does convert, one level above storage: `QuantityConverter` applies a
 * `UnitConversionFactor` an extension supplied and returns a `ConvertedQuantityValue`, which is a
 * different kind of thing from this one and carries the factor, the as-at instant and the provider that
 * justify it. A converted quantity never comes back here — conversion reads stored values and writes
 * none.
