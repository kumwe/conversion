/**
 * An amount presented in a currency it is not stored in, carrying everything needed to justify it.
 *
 * This is the non-negotiable half of the money conversion contract. A converted amount is never
 * interchangeable with a stored one: it says that it is converted, and it carries the amount and
 * currency it came from, the rate applied, the instant that rate was as at, the provider that supplied
 * the rate, the rounding rule, and the unrounded product the rounding was applied to. An operator
 * reading the figure can therefore tell, without asking anyone, whether they are looking at what was
 * agreed or at what it is worth today — and reproduce the second from the first.
 *
 * The type is the enforcement, not a convention. There is no partial shape: the constructor recomputes
 * the product from the source amount and the rate and recomputes the rounding from the declared mode,
 * so a value whose numbers do not follow from its own provenance cannot be built, let alone serialized.
 * A converted amount is also structurally unlike a stored one — `MoneyValue::toArray()`'s `amount` and
 * `currency` pair appears nowhere at this export's top level — so a write path expecting a stored money
 * value refuses a converted one rather than quietly accepting it.
 *
 * Conversion sits above storage and never enters it: a host's write-path guard admits no such
 * object into a record value, and its value codec refuses this export for a stored money field.
