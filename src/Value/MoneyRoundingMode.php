/**
 * The declared rule a conversion rounds by when the exact product is wider than the target scale.
 *
 * Multiplying an exact amount by an exact rate almost always produces more fractional digits than the
 * currency keeps, so a conversion has to say what it did with them. Rounding is therefore an explicit,
 * named step of the conversion contract rather than a side effect: the mode travels with every
 * converted amount, beside the unrounded product it was applied to, so a reader can reproduce the
 * figure instead of trusting it. Which mode a business uses is the rate owner's rule; core only
 * insists that the answer is recorded.
 *
 * The rules themselves are ordinary base-10 rounding and are shared with unit-of-measure conversion
 * through `ExactRoundingRule`; what stays specific to money is that this is the vocabulary a money
 * conversion is declared and exported in.
