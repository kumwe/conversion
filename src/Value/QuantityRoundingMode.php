/**
 * The declared rule a unit conversion rounds by when the exact product is wider than the target scale.
 *
 * Multiplying an exact quantity by an exact factor almost always produces more fractional digits than
 * the target unit keeps, so a conversion has to say what it did with them. Rounding is therefore an
 * explicit, named step of the conversion contract rather than a side effect: the mode travels with every
 * converted quantity, beside the unrounded product it was applied to, so a reader can reproduce the
 * figure instead of trusting it. Which mode a business uses is the conversion table owner's rule; core
 * only insists that the answer is recorded.
 *
 * The vocabulary matches `MoneyRoundingMode` case for case, because the arithmetic is the same
 * arithmetic; it is a separate type so a quantity conversion is declared and exported in a quantity's
 * own terms and a payload can never claim a currency rule rounded a weight.
