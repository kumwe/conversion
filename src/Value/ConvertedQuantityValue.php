/**
 * A quantity expressed in a unit it is not stored in, carrying everything needed to justify it.
 *
 * This is the non-negotiable half of the unit conversion contract, and it is the half that stops a stock
 * extension and a sales extension disagreeing about what a case of a product is. A converted quantity is
 * never interchangeable with a stored one: it says that it is converted, and it carries the quantity and
 * unit it came from, the factor applied, the instant that factor was as at, the provider that supplied
 * it, the rounding rule, and the unrounded product the rounding was applied to. An operator reading the
 * figure can therefore tell, without asking anyone, whether they are looking at what was counted or at
 * what it works out to in another unit — and reproduce the second from the first.
 *
 * The type is the enforcement, not a convention. There is no partial shape: the constructor recomputes
 * the product from the source quantity and the factor and recomputes the rounding from the declared
 * mode, so a value whose numbers do not follow from its own provenance cannot be built, let alone
 * serialized. A converted quantity is also structurally unlike a stored one — `QuantityValue::toArray()`'s
 * `amount` and `unit` pair appears nowhere at this export's top level — so a write path expecting a
 * stored quantity refuses a converted one rather than quietly accepting it.
 *
 * Conversion sits above storage and never enters it: a host's write-path guard admits no such
 * object into a record value, and its value codec refuses this export for a stored quantity field.
